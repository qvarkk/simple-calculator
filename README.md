# simple-calculator

<h2>Buggy but working calculator that took me about 20 totally worthy hours to make!</h2>
<br>
Sometimes does what any calculator is capable of, sometimes not. Depends on how much you want to break it! <br><br><br>
Made it because it was one of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin's</a> projects!
